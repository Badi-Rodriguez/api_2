# Game Character API

This is a **serverless** API built using **Node.js** that manages player character information for a game. The API is deployed on **AWS Lambda**, uses **API Gateway** to handle HTTP requests, and **DynamoDB** as the NoSQL database for storing character data.

## Features

- **Create** a new game character.
- **Retrieve** all game characters or a specific character by its ID.
- **Update** character details, such as HP, stats, and inventory.
- **Delete** a character from the database.

### Character Attributes

Each character in the game has the following attributes:

- **name**: The name of the character.
- **hp**: Health Points of the character.
- **level**: Current level of the character.
- **experience**: Experience points.
- **stats**: Object containing the following:
  - **STR**: Strength
  - **DEX**: Dexterity
  - **CON**: Constitution
  - **INT**: Intelligence
  - **WIS**: Wisdom
  - **CHA**: Charisma
- **elementalAffinity**: Character's elemental affinity (e.g., Fire, Water).
- **inventory**: A list of items (represented by name and code) carried by the character.

## API Endpoints

### Base URL

```
https://<api-gateway-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>

## Technology Stack

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service to run the API.
- **API Gateway**: To handle HTTP requests and trigger Lambda functions.
- **DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database for character data storage.
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for writing the API.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring logs and API performance.

## Getting Started

To deploy or modify this API, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Basic knowledge of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
- Node.js and NPM installed locally for development purposes

### Deployment Instructions

This API has been deployed using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **DynamoDB**. Follow these steps to deploy your own version:

1. **Create a DynamoDB table**:
   - Table Name: `GameCharacterTable`
   - Partition Key: `id` (String)

2. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - Runtime: Node.js 14.x (or higher)
   - Code: Copy the code from `app.js` to your Lambda function.

3. **Configure API Gateway**:
   - Set up the API Gateway with routes for POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE methods.
   - Integrate API Gateway routes with the Lambda function.

4. **Deploy the API**:
   - Once everything is set up, deploy your API and test using the endpoints provided above.

## Monitoring & Logs

- **AWS CloudWatch**: All requests to the API, Lambda execution logs, and errors will be automatically logged to CloudWatch. You can monitor performance, debug, and troubleshoot issues using the CloudWatch logs.
